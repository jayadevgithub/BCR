failure detected somewhere else
count is incremented
so in the next outgoing means

after message is going out of this trigger this failure
so this replica has to process this message properly


for different triggers at same client_id,request_id if we have same failure after executing once we can set the count to 0 or execute multiple times?

 checkpointing issues


 testcases
 new_configuration(0),increment_slot()


reconfig client before replicas to replicate create tail result failure and do sleep at tail before caching result shuttle


failure validation when calling perform_operation
the replicas need to check if correct slot number is being sent

checkpointing without failures-stress-test

do next checkpointing shuttle only when the first sent one is successful
