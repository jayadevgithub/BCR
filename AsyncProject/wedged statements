timer
delta calculation between the replica orderproofs and apply the orderproofs to remaining clients

orderproof contains previous replica's crytpographics hashes as well


doubts
1)at any point of time how many configurations can be active in my view only will be active
 if we are doing reconfig also only one config will be active right
2)while reading the config file we didnt specify which client executes which operation so every client needs to 
execute all the operations right
3)if we are using timer how are we going to run it python built in timer or else we need to use the logical clock
